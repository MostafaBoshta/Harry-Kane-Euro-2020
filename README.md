#Harry Shots during the tournament

Harry Kane was one of the most decisive strikers at the euro with (5) goals from 17 shots with a conversion rate of nearly 30% in 7 matches all the goals came from nearly the same area inside the box to help England reaching the final stage at the competition.

#Harry Passes during the tournament
Kane played a critical part as a play maker to help the team reach the final third with 164 passes during the whole competition to help keeping the possession to the team.
So, in my opinion Harry was the best striker in the competition and was one of the reasons that led England to the final
